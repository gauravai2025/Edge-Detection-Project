# Edge-Detection-Project

This project is a collection of edge detection algorithms implemented in MATLAB. Edge detection is a fundamental image processing technique that aims to identify boundaries between different regions in an image. The algorithms included in this project can be used to identify edges in grayscale images.

Canny Edge Detection  algorithm is used in this project:

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
<br>
Open MATLAB and navigate to the project folder.
<br>
Run the MATLAB script for the desired algorithm

Each script contains comments explaining the algorithm and its implementation. You can modify the parameters in the script to adjust the sensitivity and accuracy of the edge detection.
